### Note:
* Every assignmet passed the assessment with atleast 90% score.
* All the solutions are self-thought with learnings from the course and without any help from forums/online solutions.  
(That's why Week 2's [RandomizedQueue](https://github.com/Sharungarg/Princeton---Algorithms-Part-1/blob/master/Week%202/queues/RandomizedQueue.java) uses normalization of array whenever "empty spaces" are >= to the number of elements present in array, instead of "Swap" method)  
(Swap can make the implementation of "Dequeue" a cakewalk in RandomizedQueue.)  
_My solution also works in constant amortized time. But the method to get a random index for dequeue will have 0.5 probability of finding a valid index in the worst case, which is not great for performance._
